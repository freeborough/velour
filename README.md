Simple and effective load testing and performance analysis tool/framework.  The main purpose of the project is to be able to:

* Find the performance limits of your system.
* Help identify bottlenecks.
* Assess the performance impact of changes.

There are a few core features at the heart of the project:

* Free and open for all scales of use.
* Scale from a single CPU to a distributed multi-threaded cluster.
* Test anything, not just HTTP end points - sockets, databases, and arbitrary code.
* Integration with logging and monitoring solutions to better help you identify bottlenecks.
